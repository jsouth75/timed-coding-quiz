# JavaScript Coding Quiz

## Task

Create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores to compare to peers.
    1.  When the start button is clicked a 2 minuted timer should start along with a series of 10 questions. 
    2.  The questions are random
    3.  A list of 10 questions are presented, which once the presented question is answered the next question appears.
    4.  If a question is answered incorrectly then 10 seconds will be deducted from the time.
    5.  The quiz ends when all 10 questions are answered or the timer runs out, whichever happens first. 
    6.  Also, when the quiz is over your score will appear and prompt for your initials.
    7.  The initials and score will be saved to compare with your peers.
